            <p>Crackers hold a fascination for both young and old alike. Despite a growing anti-cracker campaign, there is no dip in its popularity. When the rocket flies high and burst opens into an umbrella of colourful embers, people from the ground watch this spectacular in awe, the beauty raining down towards them. The children quickly light up a fire wheel which dances on the floor, just as a couple of noisy bombs go off in the background. Every year Diwali arrive in all its sound and sparkle. <br>
                <br> Each year on the dark night of Diwali, Crackers of varied colors and sounds fill the skies heralding India's favourite festival. Diwali or Deepavali in Sanskrit means "a row of lamps" and fireworks have become a major part of Diwali celebrations. They form a big part of the Diwali budget in households. <br>
                <br> Firecrackers come in different varieties from the delightfully visual ones to the ear deafening noisy ones. Tradition says that the illumination of homes with lights and the skies with firecrackers is an expression of obeisance to the heavens for the attainment of health, wealth, knowledge, peace and prosperity. Another possible reason and a more scientific one for lighting firecrackers is that the fumes produced by them kill insects and mosquitoes found aplenty after the rains.
            <br><br>The standard varieties of firecrackers include the mild flower pots, the electric crackers, the popular ground wheel, the high flying rockets, the favourite sparklers and of course the explosive and ear deafening bombs. The colourful twin angles, a new entrant in the cracker market has caught the fancy of many customers. A combination of all the above makes an exclusive festive package which delights young and old alike.</p>
